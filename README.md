# hello-world
Hi everyone! My name is Dmitriy.
I'm very excited to join to the Git Community! 
This is my first repository.
Now I learning Data Sciense at Yandex Practikum and other cources around ML and DL.
This is very interesting for me. I want to be a Data Scientist and make our world is better!
Soon I will make great works here!
But now in my first repository, I just want to say "Hello!" for all.
